# Bookstore_Rental Project
Management for a library rental store
The system must keep track of both the books in the library and those that have been borrowed.
A borrowed book can be returned in a maximum of 2 weeks, otherwise, a penalty is paid for each day of delay (1% of the rental price / day late).
Requirements
- A new book can be added to the library:
- We can have several copies of the same book
- When adding a new book, we must know at least the following information:
o Name of the book
o The ISBN
o The rental price
- You can ask for a list of all the books in the library
- You can find out the number of copies available for the named book
- You can borrow and return a book.
